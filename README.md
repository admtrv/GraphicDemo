## Demo Video
Check out the project in action in this [demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19VUvfY9LF_u8xX6LrVCA58_MZeU73Gpb/view).

## Features
- **Lighting System:** Supports directional lights, point lights, shadow maping for shadows generation and dynamic lighting effects
- **Post-Processing:** Includes grayscale, blur, and bloom filters for different visual experience
- **Dynamic Elements:** Animated camera paths, interactive billiard and dartboard games
- **Procedural Generation:** Outdoor elements like trees are procedurally scattered

## Controls
- `X`: Start camera animation along a predefined path
- `M`: Cycle through post-processing filters (None, Grayscale, Blur, Bloom)
- `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `Arrow` Keys: Free-fly camera movement

## Development Notes
- Developed collaboratively with [Matej Kocalka](https://github.com/matej-kocalka)
- The code is functional but currently a bit messy; maybe I'll make the cleanup and refactoring in the future.
